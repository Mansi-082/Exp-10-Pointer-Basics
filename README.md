# Experiment 10
## Program 1
### Aim: 
Declare and initialize pointers of different data types and print the following values (Repeat for float and char data types)
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
A pointer in C++ is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Declaring a pointer involves specifying the data type of the variable it will point to, followed by an asterisk (*). Pointers must be initialized by assigning them the memory address of a variable using the address-of operator (&). Pointers play a crucial role in dynamic memory management, arrays, and efficient function parameter passing.
### Output:
![output]()
### Conclusion:
We learned about pointers in C++. 

## Program 2
### Aim: 
Access array using pointer and without using pointer variable
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
In C++, pointers can be used to access elements of an array. When an array is declared, the name of the array acts as a pointer to the first element of the array. Using pointer arithmetic, you can traverse the array by incrementing the pointer to point to subsequent elements. This method is useful in cases where you want to process arrays in functions or manage dynamic memory.
### Output:
![output]()
### Conclusion:
We learned how pointers work in arrays.
